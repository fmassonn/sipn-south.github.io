### Overview and objectives

The Sea Ice Prediction Network South (SIPN South) is pleased to invite contributors to participate in the ninth coordinated sea-ice prediction experiment in the Southern Ocean. 


Over the past seven years, we have received more than 4000 forecasts from 29 unique contributors (institutions or individuals) across five continents. We warmly thank all contributors for their interests, efforts and feedbacks. An evaluation of the forecasts collected since 2017 is available in Massonnet et al. (2023). All SIPN South contributors are automatically invited as co-authors on future papers.
