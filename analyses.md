## 2025-2026 forecasting season

SIPN South organizes the 9th forecasting season of its history.

Due to the cessation of the production of the OSI-401-b product, the analyses from this forecasting season will rely on [OSI-401d](https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/products/osi-401-b), as well as the [NSIDC-0081](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081/versions/2) product. 

We warmly thank the following groups for contributing a forecast this year:
